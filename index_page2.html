    <h2>Grandparent's Ancestry</h2>
    <p>Family histories have as a starting point the perspective of whoever is telling the story.  This one starts with author's parents and grandparents, going back, children and grandchildren going forward. The McDonnell family history goes backward into the grandparent's lines (McDonnell, McManus, Keyes, Raleigh).  For the most part the stories start with the oldest ancestor and work forward to list as many of the descendants of those ancient ancestors as can be found at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The full family history in searchable genealogy format is linked to a subsite on the Roots Magic website.  You can search for families and individuals in a name index on that site.  From there you can view individual and family profiles from a dynamic pedigree chart along with family photos.  The Roots Magic database can be downloaded in full in the format of a Roots Magic file for import into the Roots Magic application on your home computer.</p>

<p>A standard GEDCOM file (genealogical Data communication file) can also be downloaded to import into any of the other family history management applications.</p>

     <h3>Daniel Keyes</h3>
    <img src="img/PatrickMcDonnell200x200px.jpg" height="200" width="200" class="right" alt="Patrick McDonnell image" />
    <p>The Keyes family line goes backward through Lucy Agnes Keyes, Thomas Keyes, and Daniel Keyes.  Daniel is the first ancestor found.  He married Deborah Hanrahan in County Kerry, Ireland.  One of their sons, Thomas Keyes, came to the United States in 1870.  He met and married Elizabeth Riffle in ?? and they married and started a family on a homestead in Versailles, Missouri.  Some of the children and descendants of Daniel and Deborah Hanrahan Keyes are listed in the full genealogy database.  The main line is through Thomas and Elizbeth Riffle Keyes to Lucy Agnes Keyes, who married into the McDonnell family.</p>

<p>Some interesting points in the Keyes narrative:</P>


<ul>Daniel Keyes and Deborah Hanrahan were from County Kerry, Ireland, in ?? near Listowel, where they lived and died.  The photo, above, is the town of Moyvane. It was the town nearest to the farm of Daniel Keyes in Ahalahana.  It looks about the same as it would in 1870, when Daniel's son, Thomas, emigrated to the United States.</ul> 

<ul>The pioneer history in Versailles, County ??, Missouri.  Thomas Keyes and his brother-in-law, Josiah Riffle, helped build St. Patrick's Catholic church in ??.</ul>

<h3>Thomas Aloysius Raleigh</h3>
    <img src="img/PhilipMcManusTombstonewidth200px.jpg" height="299" width="200" class="right" alt="Patrick McDonnell image" />
    <p>The Raleign line is the one that goes back to George Washington and then through the signers of the Magna Carta.  Once you cut into the Washington line thie history goes through royalty.  Those lines are fairly well documented.</p>

<p>Thomas Aloysius Raleign happens to be the one about five generations back, roughy corresponding the oldest ancestor of the other lines, but a more ancient Raliegh could be chosen as a starting point.  If the story were to start that far back there would be too many descendant lines to document.  So, this document will go forward from Thomas Aloysius Raliegh and backward into the history of European royal families.  Look up the ancient history in established histories and accounts.

<!--    <h3>Adding your own header image</h3>
    <p>The default header image shows a snowy street in the small town of Porjus, northern Sweden. It is easy to add a custom header. Just replace front.jpg with an image of your own! If you use the same file name and image size as the default image, 760x175 pixels, you don't need to edit the header image tag at all.</p> -->
